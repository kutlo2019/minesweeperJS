    <h1>Welcome to Minesweeper</h1>

        <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>
            Each Minesweeper game starts out with a grid of unmarked squares. 
            After clicking one of these squares, some of the squares will #
            disappear, some will remain blank, and some will have numbers on them. 
            It's your job to use the numbers to figure out which of the blank 
            squares have mines and which are safe to click.
        </p>

        <p>
            Minesweeper is similar to a Sudoku puzzle in that your success is 
            largely contingent on being able to eliminate possible answers until 
            only one answer remains.
        </p>

        <p>
            The mouse is the only tool that you'll need to play Minesweeper. 
            The left mouse button is used to click squares that don't contain 
            mines, while the right mouse button is used to flag squares that 
            contain mines.
            On higher difficulties, you'll need to mark squares that you 
            suspect contain mines until you can verify that they do contain mines.

        </p>

        <p>
            A number on a square refers to the number of mines that are currently 
            touching that square. For example, if there are two squares touching 
            each other and one of the squares has "1" on it, you know that the 
            square next to it has a mine beneath it.
